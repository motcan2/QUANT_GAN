QUANT GAN is NN for generating realistic financial time-series. It was introduced in the paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06673](Quant GANs: Deep Generation of Financial Time Series), according to which this implementation is made.

Time-series generated by QUANT GAN can be used as training samples for other financial models, if there is a lack of real data. 

The main feature of QUANT GAN is using TCN for both Generator and Discriminator. As it shown in the paper, this approach is proved to be quaite effective. However mentioned paper contains general structure of QUANT GAN only and misses some necessary details(hyperparameters, details structure of layers and skip connections), so direct reproducing and obtaining similar results may be a bit challenging task.

As a training dataset historical changes of SP&500 index between 02.2014-02.2024 were used.
